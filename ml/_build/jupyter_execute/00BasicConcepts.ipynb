    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first phase of CRISP the overall business-case, which shall be supported by the data mining process must be clearly defined and understood. Then the goal of the data mining project itself must be defined. This includes the specification of metrics for measuring the performance of the data mining project. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second phase data must be gathered, accessed, understood and described. Quantitiy and qualitity of the data must be assessed on a high-level. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the third phase data must be investigated and understood more thoroughly. Common means for understanding data are e.g. visualization and the calculation of simple statistics. Outliers must be detected and processed, sampling rates must be determined, features must be selected and eventually be transformed to other formats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the modelling phase various algorithms and their hyperparameters are selected and applied. Their performance on the given data is determined in the evaluation phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the evaluation is usually fed back to the first phases (business- and data-understanding). Applying this feedback the techniques in the overall process are adapted and optimized. Usually only after several iterations of this process the evaluation yields good results and the project can be deployed."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A computer is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some **task T** and some **performance measure P** , if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition has a very pragmatic implication: At the very beginning of any Machine Learning project one should specify T, E and P! In some projects the determination of these elements is trivial, in particular the *task T* is usually clear. However, the determination of *experience E* and *performance measure P* can be sophisticated. Spend time to specify these elements. It will help you to understand, design and evaluate your project. \n",

    "* unsupervised learning: In this case training data consists only of inputs - no teacher is required for labeling. For example pictures can be clustered, such that similar pictures are assigned to the same group.\n",
    "* Reinforcement learning: In this type no teacher who lables each input-instance is available. However, there is a critics-element, which provides feedback from time-to-time. For example an intelligent agent in a computer game maps each input state to a corresponding action. Only after a possibly long sequence of actions the agent gets feedback in form of an increasing/decreasing High-Score.  "

    "Training and test are shown in the image below. In the training phase training-data is applied to learn a general model. The model either describes the structure of the training data (in the case of unsupervised learning) or a function, which maps input-data to outputs. Once this model is learned it can be applied in the operational phase to map new input-instances to output values (classes-index, cluster-index or numeric function-value). Before applying a learned model in operation it must be tested. In the case of supervised learning testing compares for all test-data the output of the model with the target output. This means that testing also requires labeled data. Test-data and training-data must be disjoint."

The ML engineer tries to learn a model, which minimizes both, bias- and variance-error.\n",

    "A **high bias** means that a learning algorithm has been selected, which imposes strict conditions on the type of the model, that can be learned. For example **Linear Regression** has a high bias, because only linear models can be learned. If the data can not be well fitted by such a linear model, the bias-error is high.  \n",

    "A **high variance** means that the learned model strongly varies with varying training data - even if the overall data distribution is identical. Algorithms, which are able to strongly adapt to the given training data are e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVM) with non-linear kernels or decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below the top-row (part 1 and part 2) shows a linear model of high bias (only a linear function can be learned). The variance is low because even though the training data in part 1 and part 2 is different, the learned models are similar. The lower row (part 3 and part 4) refers to an algorithm (non-linear SVM) of low-bias (many different types of functions can be learned), but high-variance, because the learned model in part 3 and part 4 are significantly different. \n",
