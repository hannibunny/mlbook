    "Neurons are the basic elements for information processing. A neuron consists of a cell-body, many dendrites and an axon. The neuron receives electrical signals from other neurons via the dendrites. In the cell-body all input-signals received via the dendrites are accumulated. If the accumulated electrical signal exceeds a certain threshold, the cell-body outputs an electrical signal via it's axon. In this case the neuron is said to be activated. Otherwise, if the accumulated input at the cell-body is below the threshold, the neuron is not active, i.e. it does not send a signal to connected neurons. The point, where dendrites of neurons are connected to axons of other neurons is called synapse. The synapse consists of an electrochemical substance. The conductivity of this substance depends on it's concentration of neurotransmitters. The process of learning adapts the conductivity of synapses and, i.e. the degree of connection between neurons. A single neuron can receive inputs from 10-100000 other neurons. However, there is only one axon, but multiple dendrites of other cell can be connected to this axon.   "

Each Neural Network has at least one input-layer and one output-layer. The number of neurons in the input-layer is determined by the number of features (attributes) in the given Machine-Learning problem. The number of neurons in the output-layer depends on the task. E.g. for **binary-classification** and **regression** only one neuron in the output-layer is requried, for classification into $K>2$ classes the output-layer consists of $K$ neurons.\n",

The drop of a defined ratio (0.1-0.5) of random neurons is valid only for one iteration. During this iteration the weights of the droped units are not adapted. In the next iteration another set of units, which are dropped temporarily is randomly selected. Dropout is only applied in the training-phase.  \n",

    "## Early MLP Example: Autonomos Driving\n",
    "The ALVINN net is a MLP with one hidden layer. It has been designed and trained for *road following* in autonomous driving. The input has been provided by a simple $30 \\times 32$ greyscale camera. As shown in the picture below, the hidden layer contains only 4 neurons. In the output-layer each of the 30 neurons belongs to one \"steering-wheel-direction\". The training data has been collected by recording videos while an expert driver steers the car. For each frame (input) the steering-wheel-direction (label) has been tracked. \n",
