    "## Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot-Encoding of words suffer from crucial drawbacks: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The vectors are usually very long - there length is given by the number of words in the vocabulary. Moreover, the vectors are quite sparse, since the set of words appearing in one document is usually only a very small part of the set of all words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "2. Semantic relations between words are not modelled. This means that in this model there is no information about the fact that word *car* is more related to word *vehicle* than to word *lake*. \n",
    "3. In the BoW-model of documents word order is totally ignored. E.g. the model can not distinguish if word *not* appeared immediately before word *good* or before word *bad*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these drawbacks can be solved by applying *Word Embeddings* and by the way the resulting *Word Empeddings* are passed e.g. to the input of Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformers (see later chapters of this lecture). \n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings have revolutionalized many fields of Natural Language Processing since their efficient neural-network-based generation has been published in [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) by Mikolov et al (2013). Word embeddings map words into vector-spaces such that semantically or syntactically related words are close together, whereas unrelated words are far from each other. Moreover, it has been shown that the word-embeddings, generated by *word2vec*-techniques *CBOW* or *Skipgram*, are well-structured in the sense that also relations such as *is-capital-of*, *is-female-of*, *is-plural-of* are encoded in the vector space. In this way questions like *woman is to queen, as man is to ?* can be answered by simple operations of linear algebra in the word-vector-space. Compared to the length of one-hot encoded word-vectors, word-embedding-vectors are short (typical lengths in the range from 100-300) and dense (float-values). \n",

    "<img src=\"https://maucher.home.hdm-stuttgart.de/Pics/dsm.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*CBOW* and *Skipgram*, are techniques to learn word-embeddings, i.e. a mapping of words to vectors by relatively simple neural networks. Usually large corpora are applied for learning, e.g. the entire Wikipedia corpus in a given language. Today, pretrained models for the most common languages are available, for example from [FastText project](https://fasttext.cc/)."

    "## How to generate Wordembeddings? CBOW and Skipgram\n",
    "In 2013 Mikolov et al. published [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf). They proposed quite simple neural network architectures to efficiently create word-embeddings: CBOW and Skipgram. These architectures are better known as **Word2Vec**. In both techniques neural networks are trained for a pseudo-task. After training, the network itself is usually not of interest. However, the learned weights in the input-layer constitute the word-embeddings, which can then be applied for a large field of NLP-tasks, e.g. document classification."

This vector representation is the input of a softmax-output-layer. The output-layer has as much neurons as there are words in the vocabulary $V$. Each neurons uniquely corresponds to a word of the vocabulary and outputs an estimation of the probaility, that the word appears as target for the current context-words at the input.  \n",
